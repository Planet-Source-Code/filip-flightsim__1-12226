ÿ{How to start from the Runway
========================

Make sure the nose of the plane is pointed exactly on the end of the runway. 
Move the nose of the plane up, and then give a little thrust (press the <Home> 
key). Keep the <Home> key pressed, until the thrust label indicates that the 
thrust <> 1.

How to land on the runway
======================

If the middle stripes on the runway are on a straight line to the runway:

________________________
                    /|\
                  /  |  \

You can land on the runway perfectly. To do that, make sure that the nose of 
the plane is pointed on the middle of the end of the runway. Then lower thrust 
to +/- 0.6. If you almost hit the runway, put your nose up to the horizon, and 
lower thrust further, until you stop.

Radar

On the radar you can see: your position; and the airport's position.
